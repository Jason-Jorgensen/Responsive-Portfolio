# Responsive Portfolio

Used Bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio site.

## Pages
- All use semantic HTML
- Have exactly identical header and footers.
- Similar styling across pages to create uniformity.
- Page formatting for easy to read code.

## HTML
- There are 4 html files: Index (home), About, Contact, and Portfolio.
- Used Bootsrap to create a grid using columns and rows. 

## CSS 
- CSS was used when better suited than bootstrap.

## Learned
- Learned the importance of having a responsive sheet that works on both desktop and cell phones.
- The majority of online traffic is now through phones and a mobile first development is important.
- Learned several classes to call different bootstrap functions.
